cybersecurity - methods, techonology and process to protect devices, systems, networks, data from damage, loss or/and unauthorized access. 
Correct actions and behaviors of people helps to keep the computer system safe.
It is very important to have a disaster and plan for recovery. Also as the first line defese educate humans.

InfoSec - Principle of Information Security - CIA triad - - confidentiality, integraty and availability.
confidentiality: data is kept confidential and private. People not authorized wont see the data. Avoid disclosure
integraty: make sure the data is authentic, accurate, reliable and free tampering. Data is not changed. Avoid alteration
availability: data is available to those who need it. Avoid Denial
Firewall helps avoiding those issues denial, disclosure and alteration


cybersecurity professionals looks for gaps or misconfigurations that can create vulnerabilities

Information protected require control and protection. Protection information system against unauthorized access, modification, destruction or DoS to authorized user.


authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) - framework that controls resources, enforces policies and audit usage.
this helps screening users and keeping track of their activities while they are connected
Authentication - process of identifying and verifying a person or thing.
Authorization - process of controlling access to resources. Privileges to access certain areas
Accounting - tracks information of agent activities on computer devices and networks (time looged in, data sent and received, their IP). Usually is used for audit, analyze user trends, billing.


Threat landscape - include all known and possible threats to computer networks. This can help to identify weaknesses in the environment.

Threat intelligence must be relevant, actionable and contextual. Depends on the company what is intellgence they classified.

Understand the attack framework enables you to anticipate your nenmy's actions and counter them.

Bad actors:
-> explorer - 
phishing, usually reputable source (microsoft, amazon, ...) and require immediate attention
spear phishing social engineering attack targeting a specific individual or group
smishing use SMS
vishing VoIP, falsifies their caller-ID to appear as from a legitimate or trustworthy source (bank, charity shop, etc).

-> Hacktivist -
usually as group against corp, government
botnet - command and control server C&C -> DDoS

->cyberterrorist
usually targets infrastructure
spear phising

->cybercriminal
they only wants money
phising
ransomware - block access computer until get paid, encrypts the data

->cyberwarrior
unpatched vuln OS and apps. zero day exploit
national interest, national resources


cybersecurity threat is an action exploiting a vuln that cause harm to a device and/or network
->social engineering
->malware
->unauthorized access
->system design failure

birthday attack - exploits a weakness in some hashing algorithms, which is used to protect passwords
the weakness is that multiple input values produce the same output value

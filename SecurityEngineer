Security is essential to businesses because ignoring it can result in operational disruptions, data leakage, lawsuits, or other forms of risk.
eliminating all risks might not be possible when running business operations. Sometimes, a decision has to be made to accept a risk and move on. 
In such a scenario, the security engineer might perform some mitigating actions to lower the risk.
Deploying the software without testing on the latest OS version will risk causing problems in the organization's operations. In such a scenario, the vulnerable OS version poses a security risk. 
A security engineer might suggest mitigating the risk by hardening the OS through additional controls and adding a reverse proxy in front of the vulnerable system to avoid exposing it to the internet. 

A security engineer works closely with both internal and external auditors to detect any non-compliance issues and effectively address them (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, NIST-800-53, and more.)
Additionally, they are responsible for upholding the organization's security certifications as needed.

A security engineer might sometimes be required to configure or fine-tune security tools such as SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs, EDRs, and more.

Tabletop exercises are often conducted to gauge the operational readiness of an organization from a security point of view. Certain scenarios are identified to be exercised, 
and security team members must explain their respective roles in the scenarios under discussion.  For example, a scenario might include the compromise of an endpoint device through a phishing email.

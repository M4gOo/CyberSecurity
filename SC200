Cybersecurity protects your digital information, devices and assets, such as your bank accounts, files, or even photos. System protection is equally important. 
It is a feature that creates restore points that allow you to set your devices to a previously healthier state before changes may have led to malfunctions or data loss. It is your backup plan.



----------- THREAT LANDSCAPE  

The threat landscape evaluation of every possible and identified threat affecting a particular sector, group of users, time period, and so forth.

Threat landscape analysis makes it possible to see potential information security problems facing a specific entity — a company, an individual, or a whole sector — and to take preventive measures by adopting a proactive approach to information security. 
This can help to identify weaknesses in the environment.

The first step toward implementing effective safeguards is to better understand the types of threats that are out there. 


----------COMMON ATTACKS   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-a-cyberattack
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/writing/how-to-choose-strong-password

TROJAN

Although Trojans behave differently depending on the type, a feature of this common approach is that a user inadvertently introduces malicious code into the organization and triggers it from behind defensive walls. 
The best defense against Trojan attacks is to practice vigilant Internet use. 
Some guidelines are: never click on an unsolicited email with unexpected attachments
always examine domain names and links before clicking on them
Pay particular attention to spelling errors, such as zeros that have been replaced by O's


RANSOMWARE

designed to cause disruption of services. targeting vital infrastructure and services.
Protect against ransomware
Use strong passwords. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and typically includes a combination of characters, numbers, and symbols.
Keep your system updated with the latest security patches.
Make sure that only people authorized for a system can use it.


BOTNET

They are a means of creating a denial of service for an organization. If a Trojan attack is a subtle attempt to bypass an application's defenses, a bot attack can be described as an all-out climbing of the walls
These requests can come from any Internet of Things (IoT) capable device that has an IP address.
A defensive approach to mitigating these types of attacks is to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. If a particular source is identified as making repeated calls that affect a system's operations, that address may be blocked.


---------------- OS

The operating system is the software component that interacts with the hardware and software programs to provide users with a standard computer experience. 
three broad categories, which are controlling hardware access, providing a user interface, and managing files and applications.
When interacting with the hardware of a computer, the operating system will communicate instructions through a device driver. These are essentially small pieces of code written by a device manufacturer, 
which allow messages and instructions to be passed between the hardware and other software to control the device.
An application will typically have an application programming interface, more commonly known as an API, which determines a set of rules for interacting with the program. 



------------------ relationship between system fail-safe protection, and server storage and backups

it is good practice to keep duplicates of your information by creating backups that run periodically.

Database servers
assessing storage needs and requirements.
One is durability, good questions to ask when assessing durability is, will it last and what is an acceptable period of time to measure durability?
Another is scalability, does it fit the data needs of the business or does your storage solution adjust accordingly as the business need grows? 
Next, availability concerns how readily available the data is and when it is needed. 
Lastly, consider security, how safe is your data? 

a business can address the problem in two ways. 
The first option is to physically acquire more storage through what is known as direct area storage or DAS. DAS involves additional secondary storage devices that physically connect to the machine accessing it.
The second is to use of Cloud storage.

 four steps protects your data from unexpected shutdowns, technological failure, and malicious cyber activity. 
one replication. This concerns copying data from one location to another. It's like the autosave function in Microsoft Word that keeps recoverable near realtime copies of your information. 
two is snapshots. A data snapshot is a regular save point throughout the day. It's good to implement a policy to schedule automatic saving of all your business information. 
third step involves daily backups. In addition to regular snapshots, it's beneficial to store your information in a second location that is not on your premises (Cloud)
forth step is what is known as the 3-2-1 backup strategy. If the information is particularly important, why not create three snapshots of the data? This is exactly what the 3-2-1 strategy is. 
Use two different formats, such as locally on your computer where you create the information, as well as on your data server. Ideally, one of these copies is kept off site. 
This way, the essential information used to run your business is always protected. Have different levels of importance, so implementing the 3-2-1 backup strategy may be considered excessive. 

 backup storage are durability, scalability, availability, and security.

-------------------- environment cloud and on-premises

cloud
pros - lower upfront cost, pay as you need, easier scaling
cons - at risk wider range of threats, constant connection, bound to laws of data storage locations
on-premises
pros - full control hardware, data, software, less vuln to cyberattacks
cons - higher initial cost, less flexible fo scaling

The concept of a firewall applies differently for Cloud environments than it does for on-premises environments.
Whereas an on-premises firewall only needs to monitor external traffic that tries to enter the system, the distinctions are less clear in a Cloud setup in which many system resources may be outside of the system

--------------------- protect the environment

Fundamentally, the steps are the same. Stop unauthorized access, limit mobility within a system once accessed, and employ a backup strategy
Establishing good policies and procedures is vital regardless of how large the lock guard and your door is, it is only useful if the building is secure.
Specifically, a good policy must be able to prevent unauthorized access, limit mobility within a system, and minimize any damage resulting from a breach.

the first step in protecting data is monitoring traffic or incoming traffic is vetted before it can access the system. 
Next managing the endpoints (mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, cloud desktops, servers, and embedded devices, or any specialized devices needed for executing the business needs)
next, identification using Identity and Access Management or IAM. Azure has a dedicated IAM called Active Directory, which ensures that access to specific documentation and services is only given to the appropriate people.
it's not enough to only monitor who gains access. There must also be a means to control what changes they are allowed to perform. 
Finally, one of the strongest measures a company can employ whether on-premises or cloud-based, is to provide technical training for staff. 


Zero Standing Access 
is the overarching concept that access to the production environment must be kept to a minimum and cannot be maintained over time. 
This means that you must validate that you are authorized whenever you wish to access areas related to production. 
Even so, your access will only allow you to make sufficient changes to the area you have been authorized to access.
Zero Standing access is an example of security policy of reducing access

Just-In-Time (JIT)
This means that after accessing a certain area, the user will only maintain access for a limited period of time before being automatically ejected or asked to re-enter an authorization code. 

Just-Enough-Access (JEA)
is about limitations on the changes you can make while you are in the area accessed.

----------------------- Maintanance and Patches

Software updates take an existing piece of code and alter it. 
Motivations for this include adding and improving functionality, addressing and enhancing a security-related element, and removing bugs that affect how a program operates. 

Patches are for newly identified shortcomings or dangers in existing software. They are small pieces of code that only modify the target area without impacting the general function of an application.
The code deployed is never perfect. Over time incompatibilities or issues are identified. 
If the issue is determined to pose an immediate danger to a system then a patch will be issued to address the issue immediately. 
Later, at a scheduled update, a more permanent solution will be deployed. There are two categories of patches. 
First, a bug fix patch is when an issue is identified with the code and the patch temporarily covers it. The second type is a security patch. 
It is when a vulnerability that can be exploited for malicious intent is identified. 
There are also concerns of how an update can make a familiar working environment unfamiliar by changing the layout or removing previously used elements. 
Some patches also add functionality that is not required, and may even degrade the performance of other features. 
Some users become reluctant to accept updates due to poor experiences that change the interface in a way that was undesirable. 


patches are designed to prevent and mediate issues with code. Maintenance is defined as all the changes made to a code after deployment. This includes all the patches and updates. 
A hot patch is an alteration to the code that does not require a system reboot. A cold patch requires the system to be rebooted before the update becomes active. 


Software development is always evolving, and code written today is built on existing code. New software is usually a new variation of code that already exists. 
This means that code written for one purpose is repurposed and used in a later iteration. This can lead to redundant code that potentially acts in different ways than expected.

Bugs are codes that execute unexpectedly and sometimes produce an unintended result. Additionally, security defense and attack measures constantly reveal new vulnerabilities and potential problems with software applications. 
To resolve these issues, the code is continually maintained and updated.

Maintanances measures
predictive - It is the practice of applying maintenance due to a signal that a failure will occur. Signals are determined by analyzing device signature patterns and predicting failure points.
routine - preventative
corrective - necessary repair

The company can choose to accept the vulnerability. This approach means that the company has identified a potential weakness or failure. However, it leaves the problem unresolved.
This may be done because the fix is ​​too large or because the damage that could be done is not great enough to justify the time spent fixing it.


---------------- CVSS

This is a standardized metric used to assess threat levels. However, in some systems, a combination of problems that arise tends to expose the network.
While CVSS can indicate some dangers, the fault in a company's system could be a combination of outdated software coupled with an open port and some other misconfigurations. 
Therefore, the IT professional evaluates each incident on a case-by-case basis. Analysis tools can only give indications; they do not guarantee the security of a system.

---------------- Email

emails are sent using the simple mail transfer protocol and retrieved with the pop three protocol. 
Alternatively, you could use an email client, which is typically an application that you install on your computer. 
A major advantage of an email client is that it allows you to access your existing messages without being online. 
There are many options available, and some of the most popular include Outlook, Gmail, and Thunderbird

Spam refers to unwanted or unsolicited email sent in bulk via text or email. 
Typically, these emails appear as advertisements that attempt to get you to purchase or sign up for a product or website.
But sometimes they ask for more, like trying to get your personal information. 
Even worse, they can be sent as a Trojan horse that encourages you to click on a link that will release malicious code into your system.

Phishing emails are messages that attempt to hook people into revealing confidential information about themselves. They usually ask the user to click on a link and enter their details into it.
Email spoofing is when a fraudulent email from a known source, such as Amazon or the post office, attempts to trick the user into taking an action, such as completing a payment.
Spear phishing refers to emails created to be from someone you know, with some incentive to click on a link or trigger malware to be installed on the computer.
Whaling is a type of spear phishing attack targeting CEOs or senior executives, with threats of legal ramifications if not responded to.
Advertisements are emails that offer products or services. The offers may be legitimate, but they are often unsolicited and it may take a lot of effort to stop them.
Chain letters: Emails that state that you will have bad luck if you don't forward them to 5 friends. This is a practice that has evolved and is practiced with social media posts.


email providers now offer filtering options that will protect users from spam. 
That includes:
Automatic, continuous virus scanning, which continuously scans content for spam.
Connection filtering monitors the sender profile and only allows in from trusted sources.
Filtering functionality that is based on lists of domains and sites that are allowed or not.
Quarantine is when suspicious messages are labeled as dangerous and kept separate for further investigation.

------------------- Storage

The Azure storage platform includes the following data services. 
Azure Files, which manages file-sharing for Cloud-based storage. 
Azure Blob Storage, which is scalable object store for text and binary data. 
Azure Managed Disks, which involves block-level storage that's accessible using virtual machines. You can have the benefits of versatile storage by integrating Azure Managed Disks into your business setup
Azure allows data access through several methods including HTTP, HTTPS, and rest API. This is the same as accessing a web page by typing the URL in the search bar. 
The difference is that you first need to be authorized to access these sites. This can be useful for remote collaboration, for example, 
say there is a document saved in Azure files that is edited by several employees. They can access the document from various locations, but each employee first needs to login securely to gain access. 


Data is categorized as structured or unstructured data. 

structured data. When you fill out a form, each column has a name and a place to enter the appropriate data, this is an example of structured data. 
Another example is a database table. In every table there are rows and columns and each of the values in the columns relates to the row. 
In databases, information is ordered according to the Schema. The Schema is the template database uses to decide what type of data goes where.

unstructured data, which is less organized with no clear path for searching or filtering. 
Imagine taking your favorite book, separating each page, then placing the individual pages into a box and shaking it. All the information is still there, but there was no structure in how it is saved. 
You may have come across the term blobs. Blob is an acronym that stands for binary large objects, and it simply stores unstructured data. As the name suggests, it stores large, unstructured objects. 
Examples of unstructured data that accompany may keep include streaming data from the security cameras or sensor output data from on-premises devices.

Blob works
Blobs are stored in containers. This is like a filing system where each container has a general name like pictures or movies. Inside this container, you can store as many blogs as required.
The blobs themselves will be unstructured, and further filtering or searching methods are needed to find a specific item inside the blob.


--------- data lake

A repository that stores large amounts of data for later processing is known as a data lake. A data lake allows actionable insights to be extracted from the data at a later stage, like reports, big data, analysis


Data Lake Benefits and Challenges

Data lakes are widely used and maintained by companies, but why is this the case? Some of the reasons may include:

The data may be more valuable in the future in ways that are not currently known.
By storing the data wholesale, scientists can make different exploratory queries with the aim of discerning some valuable insights. These potential insights can be lost if data is processed before it is stored.
The unstructured nature of a data lake means that data can be stored in a variety of ways and does not need to be processed and transformed beforehand.

In addition to their benefits, data lakes also present some challenges, such as the following:

The lack of a schema means that data does not need to be processed before being stored. However, this makes it difficult to query and find specific data.
A lack of data analysis means there is no way to ensure that the data stored has merit or value.
Security can be an additional challenge, as lack of knowledge about the quality of stored data makes it more difficult to regulate access.
The lack of structure to data means that some information can be lost or forgotten over time.


------- data warehousing

A data warehouse is like a data lake, except that the information found in it has been processed and cleaned so that it is easily acceptable. 
To do this, lake data is extracted, formatted, validated, summarized, and otherwise processed and stored in the data warehouse. When the data is in the data warehouse, 
it is possible to obtain actionable intelligence from it.


Data warehouse benefits and challenges

A company may choose a data warehouse over a data lake for the following reasons:

It serves as a single source of truth as past performance can be compared with current performance. For example, if a company implements a new format for maintaining records, it can reference historical record storage to prove the effectiveness of the new approach.
A data warehouse enables the filtering and cleaning of data in a data lake and facilitates analysis to obtain essential, actionable insights.
Data warehouses store information in a structured way. This makes it much easier to apply learning models to data without having to change the way the data is presented.
A data warehouse leads to greater awareness of data and allows for a better verification process for proper access.

However, remember that data warehouses do not come without some disadvantages, such as the following:

Creating a data warehouse from a data lake requires significant effort. It can be challenging to know how data is structured without in-depth investigation. For example, images or words may need to be converted to numbers for analysis, but formatting data for one purpose may be inappropriate for another.
Domain expertise is required to orchestrate the data. Due to the potential size of data lakes, data transfer and processing can be expensive. Therefore, before applying any process, a domain expert must identify what and how data should be transferred.
Cleaning data into a desirable format can be challenging when there are many data items.


Three useful Azure technologies that can be used for data storage are:

Azure SQL Database: A fully managed cloud relational database that offers automatic remediation, built-in security, and on-demand data protection.
Azure Synapse Analytics: A service that optimizes analytics tasks to provide faster insights. It provides integration between Microsoft's data warehousing and big data analytics capabilities in a single service.
Apache Hive: Data warehouse software built on top of Hadoop (a framework for online distributed databases) to provide data summarization, querying, and analysis.

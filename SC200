Cybersecurity protects your digital information, devices and assets, such as your bank accounts, files, or even photos. System protection is equally important. 
It is a feature that creates restore points that allow you to set your devices to a previously healthier state before changes may have led to malfunctions or data loss. It is your backup plan.

InfoSec - Principle of Information Security - CIA triad - - confidentiality, integraty and availability.
confidentiality: data is kept confidential and private. People not authorized wont see the data. Avoid disclosure
integraty: make sure the data is authentic, accurate, reliable and free tampering. Data is not changed. Avoid alteration
availability: data is available to those who need it. Avoid Denial
Firewall helps avoiding those issues denial, disclosure and alteration

authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) - framework that controls resources, enforces policies and audit usage.
this helps screening users and keeping track of their activities while they are connected
Authentication - process of identifying and verifying a person or thing.
Authorization - process of controlling access to resources. Privileges to access certain areas
Accounting - tracks information of agent activities on computer devices and networks (time loged in, data sent and received, their IP). Usually is used for audit, analyze user trends, billing.

----------- THREAT LANDSCAPE  

The threat landscape evaluation of every possible and identified threat affecting a particular sector, group of users, time period, and so forth.

Threat landscape analysis makes it possible to see potential information security problems facing a specific entity — a company, an individual, or a whole sector — and to take preventive measures by adopting a proactive approach to information security. 
This can help to identify weaknesses in the environment.

The first step toward implementing effective safeguards is to better understand the types of threats that are out there. 


----------COMMON ATTACKS   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-a-cyberattack
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/writing/how-to-choose-strong-password

TROJAN

Although Trojans behave differently depending on the type, a feature of this common approach is that a user inadvertently introduces malicious code into the organization and triggers it from behind defensive walls. 
The best defense against Trojan attacks is to practice vigilant Internet use. 
Some guidelines are: never click on an unsolicited email with unexpected attachments
always examine domain names and links before clicking on them
Pay particular attention to spelling errors, such as zeros that have been replaced by O's


RANSOMWARE

designed to cause disruption of services. targeting vital infrastructure and services.
Protect against ransomware
Use strong passwords. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and typically includes a combination of characters, numbers, and symbols.
Keep your system updated with the latest security patches.
Make sure that only people authorized for a system can use it.


BOTNET

They are a means of creating a denial of service for an organization. If a Trojan attack is a subtle attempt to bypass an application's defenses, a bot attack can be described as an all-out climbing of the walls
These requests can come from any Internet of Things (IoT) capable device that has an IP address.
A defensive approach to mitigating these types of attacks is to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. If a particular source is identified as making repeated calls that affect a system's operations, that address may be blocked.


---------------- OS

The operating system is the software component that interacts with the hardware and software programs to provide users with a standard computer experience. 
three broad categories, which are controlling hardware access, providing a user interface, and managing files and applications.
When interacting with the hardware of a computer, the operating system will communicate instructions through a device driver. These are essentially small pieces of code written by a device manufacturer, 
which allow messages and instructions to be passed between the hardware and other software to control the device.
An application will typically have an application programming interface, more commonly known as an API, which determines a set of rules for interacting with the program. 



------------------ relationship between system fail-safe protection, and server storage and backups

it is good practice to keep duplicates of your information by creating backups that run periodically.

Database servers
assessing storage needs and requirements.
One is durability, good questions to ask when assessing durability is, will it last and what is an acceptable period of time to measure durability?
Another is scalability, does it fit the data needs of the business or does your storage solution adjust accordingly as the business need grows? 
Next, availability concerns how readily available the data is and when it is needed. 
Lastly, consider security, how safe is your data? 

a business can address the problem in two ways. 
The first option is to physically acquire more storage through what is known as direct area storage or DAS. DAS involves additional secondary storage devices that physically connect to the machine accessing it.
The second is to use of Cloud storage.

 four steps protects your data from unexpected shutdowns, technological failure, and malicious cyber activity. 
one replication. This concerns copying data from one location to another. It's like the autosave function in Microsoft Word that keeps recoverable near realtime copies of your information. 
two is snapshots. A data snapshot is a regular save point throughout the day. It's good to implement a policy to schedule automatic saving of all your business information. 
third step involves daily backups. In addition to regular snapshots, it's beneficial to store your information in a second location that is not on your premises (Cloud)
forth step is what is known as the 3-2-1 backup strategy. If the information is particularly important, why not create three snapshots of the data? This is exactly what the 3-2-1 strategy is. 
Use two different formats, such as locally on your computer where you create the information, as well as on your data server. Ideally, one of these copies is kept off site. 
This way, the essential information used to run your business is always protected. Have different levels of importance, so implementing the 3-2-1 backup strategy may be considered excessive. 

 backup storage are durability, scalability, availability, and security.

-------------------- environment cloud and on-premises

cloud
pros - lower upfront cost, pay as you need, easier scaling
cons - at risk wider range of threats, constant connection, bound to laws of data storage locations
on-premises
pros - full control hardware, data, software, less vuln to cyberattacks
cons - higher initial cost, less flexible fo scaling

The concept of a firewall applies differently for Cloud environments than it does for on-premises environments.
Whereas an on-premises firewall only needs to monitor external traffic that tries to enter the system, the distinctions are less clear in a Cloud setup in which many system resources may be outside of the system

--------------------- protect the environment

Fundamentally, the steps are the same. Stop unauthorized access, limit mobility within a system once accessed, and employ a backup strategy
Establishing good policies and procedures is vital regardless of how large the lock guard and your door is, it is only useful if the building is secure.
Specifically, a good policy must be able to prevent unauthorized access, limit mobility within a system, and minimize any damage resulting from a breach.

the first step in protecting data is monitoring traffic or incoming traffic is vetted before it can access the system. 
Next managing the endpoints (mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, cloud desktops, servers, and embedded devices, or any specialized devices needed for executing the business needs)
next, identification using Identity and Access Management or IAM. Azure has a dedicated IAM called Active Directory, which ensures that access to specific documentation and services is only given to the appropriate people.
it's not enough to only monitor who gains access. There must also be a means to control what changes they are allowed to perform. 
Finally, one of the strongest measures a company can employ whether on-premises or cloud-based, is to provide technical training for staff. 


Zero Standing Access 
is the overarching concept that access to the production environment must be kept to a minimum and cannot be maintained over time. 
This means that you must validate that you are authorized whenever you wish to access areas related to production. 
Even so, your access will only allow you to make sufficient changes to the area you have been authorized to access.
Zero Standing access is an example of security policy of reducing access

Just-In-Time (JIT)
This means that after accessing a certain area, the user will only maintain access for a limited period of time before being automatically ejected or asked to re-enter an authorization code. 

Just-Enough-Access (JEA)
is about limitations on the changes you can make while you are in the area accessed.

----------------------- Maintanance and Patches

Software updates take an existing piece of code and alter it. 
Motivations for this include adding and improving functionality, addressing and enhancing a security-related element, and removing bugs that affect how a program operates. 

Patches are for newly identified shortcomings or dangers in existing software. They are small pieces of code that only modify the target area without impacting the general function of an application.
The code deployed is never perfect. Over time incompatibilities or issues are identified. 
If the issue is determined to pose an immediate danger to a system then a patch will be issued to address the issue immediately. 
Later, at a scheduled update, a more permanent solution will be deployed. There are two categories of patches. 
First, a bug fix patch is when an issue is identified with the code and the patch temporarily covers it. The second type is a security patch. 
It is when a vulnerability that can be exploited for malicious intent is identified. 
There are also concerns of how an update can make a familiar working environment unfamiliar by changing the layout or removing previously used elements. 
Some patches also add functionality that is not required, and may even degrade the performance of other features. 
Some users become reluctant to accept updates due to poor experiences that change the interface in a way that was undesirable. 


patches are designed to prevent and mediate issues with code. Maintenance is defined as all the changes made to a code after deployment. This includes all the patches and updates. 
A hot patch is an alteration to the code that does not require a system reboot. A cold patch requires the system to be rebooted before the update becomes active. 


Software development is always evolving, and code written today is built on existing code. New software is usually a new variation of code that already exists. 
This means that code written for one purpose is repurposed and used in a later iteration. This can lead to redundant code that potentially acts in different ways than expected.

Bugs are codes that execute unexpectedly and sometimes produce an unintended result. Additionally, security defense and attack measures constantly reveal new vulnerabilities and potential problems with software applications. 
To resolve these issues, the code is continually maintained and updated.

Maintanances measures
predictive - It is the practice of applying maintenance due to a signal that a failure will occur. Signals are determined by analyzing device signature patterns and predicting failure points.
routine - preventative
corrective - necessary repair

The company can choose to accept the vulnerability. This approach means that the company has identified a potential weakness or failure. However, it leaves the problem unresolved.
This may be done because the fix is ​​too large or because the damage that could be done is not great enough to justify the time spent fixing it.


---------------- CVSS

This is a standardized metric used to assess threat levels. However, in some systems, a combination of problems that arise tends to expose the network.
While CVSS can indicate some dangers, the fault in a company's system could be a combination of outdated software coupled with an open port and some other misconfigurations. 
Therefore, the IT professional evaluates each incident on a case-by-case basis. Analysis tools can only give indications; they do not guarantee the security of a system.

---------------- Email

emails are sent using the simple mail transfer protocol and retrieved with the pop three protocol. 
Alternatively, you could use an email client, which is typically an application that you install on your computer. 
A major advantage of an email client is that it allows you to access your existing messages without being online. 
There are many options available, and some of the most popular include Outlook, Gmail, and Thunderbird

Spam refers to unwanted or unsolicited email sent in bulk via text or email. 
Typically, these emails appear as advertisements that attempt to get you to purchase or sign up for a product or website.
But sometimes they ask for more, like trying to get your personal information. 
Even worse, they can be sent as a Trojan horse that encourages you to click on a link that will release malicious code into your system.

Phishing emails are messages that attempt to hook people into revealing confidential information about themselves. They usually ask the user to click on a link and enter their details into it.
Email spoofing is when a fraudulent email from a known source, such as Amazon or the post office, attempts to trick the user into taking an action, such as completing a payment.
Spear phishing refers to emails created to be from someone you know, with some incentive to click on a link or trigger malware to be installed on the computer.
Whaling is a type of spear phishing attack targeting CEOs or senior executives, with threats of legal ramifications if not responded to.
Advertisements are emails that offer products or services. The offers may be legitimate, but they are often unsolicited and it may take a lot of effort to stop them.
Chain letters: Emails that state that you will have bad luck if you don't forward them to 5 friends. This is a practice that has evolved and is practiced with social media posts.


email providers now offer filtering options that will protect users from spam. 
That includes:
Automatic, continuous virus scanning, which continuously scans content for spam.
Connection filtering monitors the sender profile and only allows in from trusted sources.
Filtering functionality that is based on lists of domains and sites that are allowed or not.
Quarantine is when suspicious messages are labeled as dangerous and kept separate for further investigation.

------------------- Storage

The Azure storage platform includes the following data services. 
Azure Files, which manages file-sharing for Cloud-based storage. 
Azure Blob Storage, which is scalable object store for text and binary data. 
Azure Managed Disks, which involves block-level storage that's accessible using virtual machines. You can have the benefits of versatile storage by integrating Azure Managed Disks into your business setup
Azure allows data access through several methods including HTTP, HTTPS, and rest API. This is the same as accessing a web page by typing the URL in the search bar. 
The difference is that you first need to be authorized to access these sites. This can be useful for remote collaboration, for example, 
say there is a document saved in Azure files that is edited by several employees. They can access the document from various locations, but each employee first needs to login securely to gain access. 


Data is categorized as structured or unstructured data. 

structured data. When you fill out a form, each column has a name and a place to enter the appropriate data, this is an example of structured data. 
Another example is a database table. In every table there are rows and columns and each of the values in the columns relates to the row. 
In databases, information is ordered according to the Schema. The Schema is the template database uses to decide what type of data goes where.

unstructured data, which is less organized with no clear path for searching or filtering. 
Imagine taking your favorite book, separating each page, then placing the individual pages into a box and shaking it. All the information is still there, but there was no structure in how it is saved. 
You may have come across the term blobs. Blob is an acronym that stands for binary large objects, and it simply stores unstructured data. As the name suggests, it stores large, unstructured objects. 
Examples of unstructured data that accompany may keep include streaming data from the security cameras or sensor output data from on-premises devices.

Blob works
Blobs are stored in containers. This is like a filing system where each container has a general name like pictures or movies. Inside this container, you can store as many blogs as required.
The blobs themselves will be unstructured, and further filtering or searching methods are needed to find a specific item inside the blob.


--------- data lake   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-lake-analytics/

A repository that stores large amounts of data for later processing is known as a data lake. A data lake allows actionable insights to be extracted from the data at a later stage, like reports, big data, analysis


Data Lake Benefits and Challenges

Data lakes are widely used and maintained by companies, but why is this the case? Some of the reasons may include:

The data may be more valuable in the future in ways that are not currently known.
By storing the data wholesale, scientists can make different exploratory queries with the aim of discerning some valuable insights. These potential insights can be lost if data is processed before it is stored.
The unstructured nature of a data lake means that data can be stored in a variety of ways and does not need to be processed and transformed beforehand.

In addition to their benefits, data lakes also present some challenges, such as the following:

The lack of a schema means that data does not need to be processed before being stored. However, this makes it difficult to query and find specific data.
A lack of data analysis means there is no way to ensure that the data stored has merit or value.
Security can be an additional challenge, as lack of knowledge about the quality of stored data makes it more difficult to regulate access.
The lack of structure to data means that some information can be lost or forgotten over time.


------- data warehousing

A data warehouse is like a data lake, except that the information found in it has been processed and cleaned so that it is easily acceptable. 
To do this, lake data is extracted, formatted, validated, summarized, and otherwise processed and stored in the data warehouse. When the data is in the data warehouse, 
it is possible to obtain actionable intelligence from it.


Data warehouse benefits and challenges

A company may choose a data warehouse over a data lake for the following reasons:

It serves as a single source of truth as past performance can be compared with current performance. For example, if a company implements a new format for maintaining records, it can reference historical record storage to prove the effectiveness of the new approach.
A data warehouse enables the filtering and cleaning of data in a data lake and facilitates analysis to obtain essential, actionable insights.
Data warehouses store information in a structured way. This makes it much easier to apply learning models to data without having to change the way the data is presented.
A data warehouse leads to greater awareness of data and allows for a better verification process for proper access.

However, remember that data warehouses do not come without some disadvantages, such as the following:

Creating a data warehouse from a data lake requires significant effort. It can be challenging to know how data is structured without in-depth investigation. For example, images or words may need to be converted to numbers for analysis, but formatting data for one purpose may be inappropriate for another.
Domain expertise is required to orchestrate the data. Due to the potential size of data lakes, data transfer and processing can be expensive. Therefore, before applying any process, a domain expert must identify what and how data should be transferred.
Cleaning data into a desirable format can be challenging when there are many data items.


Three useful Azure technologies that can be used for data storage are:

Azure SQL Database: A fully managed cloud relational database that offers automatic remediation, built-in security, and on-demand data protection.
Azure Synapse Analytics: A service that optimizes analytics tasks to provide faster insights. It provides integration between Microsoft's data warehousing and big data analytics capabilities in a single service.
Apache Hive: Data warehouse software built on top of Hadoop (a framework for online distributed databases) to provide data summarization, querying, and analysis.


---------------- Machine Learning

It is possible to automate much of the analysis by training a computer to do it instead through a process called machine learning. 
Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence that helps machines learn from data and make predictions. 
It's a way of teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make decisions based on what it has learned. 
can teach the computer how to find patterns in whatever you want, for example, sales data using a set of rules called algorithms. This helps the computer to better understand the data.

it can be applied to cybersecurity as well, so how would that work?
Imagine you are a security specialist and you want to prevent unauthorized entry into a system, you might set up a rule that too many failed login attempts will lock in account for awhile. 
Or you might note the location and prevent access if it is different from what is expected.

You may want to create a system to monitor credit card transactions for fraudulent activity. To reduce illegal activity, sophisticated machine learning models are trained to identify anomalies in a customer's action. 
To train a learning model for this, a representation of your daily activities is built. 
When processing images, these data points can be represented by pixels. In this case, the same algorithm may instead receive different data points, such as:

The frequency of the activity.
The location from where a transaction was executed.
The amounts spent.
The types of purchases made.

When a flag is raised, it can trigger another action, such as sending an alert notification or activating an authentication application that needs to be released before the action is sanctioned. 
The training data for these models is created based on previous transactions and instances labeled as "standard" and fraudulent. 
First, the algorithm will identify anomalous activity or activity that deviates from the pattern. This can be used to apply additional checks to determine whether fraudulent behavior is occurring. 
Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to detect attack patterns. Company logs after a breach can be analyzed to identify any patterns of activity that indicate an attack is in progress or about to happen. 
These are called signature patterns.

Machine learning engineers have created smart solutions that can catch the small giveaway details that people often miss. This leads to more capable cybersecurity systems that demand less human vigilance.
By analyzing a senders emails a machine can learn to distinguish the tiny differences that separate a fake email from the real thing.

Why is it important to preprocess data before using it to train a machine learning model? 
if the data contains errors, the computer will give poor or inaccurate predicitions


================== NETWORKING ========================

A network is a group of connected devices that can communicate with one another and share resources.
WANs cover vast areas like a city or even a whole country. The Internet is an example of a wide area network.
metropolitan area network, or MAN. A MAN is used to connect local area networks located in different buildings or neighborhoods within a city. It is mostly used by organizations that have multiple locations within a city. 
SAN, which is used to provide multiple servers access to storage devices such as hard drives. 


These include bus, ring, star, mesh, entry topologies.
A network topology determines how devices are connected and data travels through the network.

Bus topology is best for small networks with few devices that are located close together.
All devices on the network receive the data, but only the device that the data is intended for processes it. 

ring topology, which connects devices in a loop or circle. Data is sent from one device to another in a specific order, and each device repeats the data before passing it on to the next device. 
In a ring topology, data travels in only one direction and the devices are linked to each other through connectors. 
Ring topology is usually used for high-speed data transfers between devices in a closed loop network when the data needs to travel in a specific direction from one device to another. 

star topology, devices are connected to a central switch. The switch acts as a central control point for the network and all data is sent through it. 
In a star topology, each device is connected to the switch with its own cable. This is the most common topology used in homes or small offices
is simple and it provides and maintains good performance. It's also very simple to troubleshoot because it's easy to isolate and investigate one device without affecting others

mesh topology, in which devices are connected to each other in a network of interlocking nodes. An interlocking node is when a device is connected to two or more devices in a mesh network. 
In such an arrangement, data can be sent from one device to another through multiple paths and there is no central point of control. 
Mesh topology is a good choice when the reliability is important because if one path fails, data can be sent through another path.

tree topology. In this case, devices are connected to a central bus or line, and then sub-networks are created with their own bus or line. Each sub-network can then have its own tree topology. 
Tree topology is also known as hierarchical topology. It is used for medium to large size networks where multiple star topologies need to be connected to each other. 


A   10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
B   172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
C   192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

By default, Windows uses APIPA to assign itself an IP address automatically from the 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 address range.

Hybrid networks come in many different shapes and sizes. But it's the mix of connectivity types that makes them hybrid. 

What is cloud?
1 - On-Demand Self-Service - can provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction.
2 - Broad Network Access - access services over the network and accessed through mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
3 - Resource Pooling - no control or knowledge over the exact location of the resources, those resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.
4 - Rapid Elasticity - capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly in response to system load
5 - Measured Service - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed. Pay for what you consume


--------- OSI model

The first advantage of the OSI model is that it provides an organized structure by dividing the functions of a network into seven transparent layers. 
This makes it easier for network administrators and engineers to understand the flow of data and troubleshoot problems.

OSI model is also widely accepted and standardized. This simplifies communication and collaboration between different networks and vendors.

Each layer in the OSI model can be modified or improved independently without affecting the other layers. 

The bottom layer, or the physical layer, converts the data into wireless or electrical signals for transmission through the air or through cables.
The next layer, the data link layer, ensures that the data is ready for transmission by making sure it is reliable and error free. 
The network layer selects the best path to route data packets over a network and addresses devices with the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. 
Then the transport layer establishes connections between devices and can ensure reliable transport between the two. 
The fifth layer, the session layer, is responsible for managing communication sessions or states between applications. 
Next up, the presentation layer's role is quite interesting since it deals with data formatting, encryption, decryption, and data presentation. 
And the final layer, or the application layer, plays an essential role by enabling the users or devices to communicate with each other. 
This layer provides an interface with which you can access the network to perform the necessary tasks.


smtp, http protocol - application layer (TCP/IP SUITE)
TCP, UDP protocol - transport layer (TCP/IP SUITE)
IPv4, IPv6 protocol - internet layer (TCP/IP SUITE)
Ethernet, WiFi protocol - network access layer (TCP/IP SUITE)


-------- TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the primary protocol used all over the world by millions of devices to send information online on different kinds of networks. 

The Internet Protocol or IP ensures the packets get to the right destination and the Transmission Control Protocol or TCP makes sure that the packets arrive safely and in the correct order. 
even if some packages get lost along the way, TCP will send them again to make sure the information gets to its destination intact.

First, data is divided into smaller parts called packets, before being sent over the network. These packets then travel over the network, which may be physical wires or wireless signals to reach their destination. 
The next step is the reception of the packets. The destination device collects all the packets and puts them back together to recreate the original data. But sometimes data can get lost along its journey. 
So the fourth step is to make sure all the packets are correct and have arrived in the right order. 
For this reason, the TCP protocol adds extra information to each segment of data known as a sequence number and acknowledgment number. 
When delivered successfully, an acknowledgment will be sent back to close the process. 
But the TCP delivery check process can only happen once devices have found each other over the network, and this happens next with the IP protocol
The bottom layer is the network interface or data link layer and is physical link between the computer and the network. 
It is responsible for sending and receiving data over the network using hardware such as network adapters. The next layer, the Internet layer, forwards packets from the source to the destination.
The transport layer works in the background and ensures that the data is sent reliably, meaning all data packets are verified by the TCP protocol, but this takes time.
The top layer, the application layer deals with the applications running on the devices and the data that they generate. In other words, it provides an interface for the user to access network resources. 


A camada de transporte é responsável pela entrega de dados entre aplicativos em hosts separados.
A camada da Internet é responsável por endereçar e rotear pacotes de dados entre redes

 IP addresses are vital in identifying different devices on a network to route traffic to the intended destination.

ports, and they allow various types of data to be sent and received by specific applications.
ports identify and allow certain types of data to access the network. 
if data tries to enter a network without the proper port number, the network's security measures, like firewalls, may block its entry to protect against unauthorized access.
Port numbers are used to identify different types of data during transmission and are assigned within the transport layer of both the TCP IP suite and the OSI model.

Firewalls rely on port numbers to permit or deny access to a network, but managing the range of port numbers is equally important to prevent unauthorized access. 

Port numbers identify a particular application or service on a system. An IP address identifies a machine in an IP network and determines the destination of a data packet, 
while port numbers identify particular applications or services on a system.

The sender selects a source and destination IP address and identifies the protocol they want to use, which is SMTP. SMTP uses port number 25 for its communication.
The destination port is always the service or protocol being accessed. Once the protocol is chosen, the devices involved have a set of rules to follow to ensure the conversation is successful.

By using a separate port number for each session, multiple sessions can be opened simultaneously on the computer

The DNS server acts as a translator, taking the name you typed and converting it to an IP address that can be located for the relevant website. 
The IP address is stored in the DNS server as a record and there are a number of record types. The DNS server will use an address record or a record when simply looking for a website name translation. 
Another type of record is a domain name system service record, or SRP, which can tell the device what services are available for a particular website
DNS needs to be fast. UDP is the preferred protocol because it doesn't provide packet delivery check overheads.

Monitoring can be divided into two main tasks: network monitoring and network traffic monitoring. On the one hand, network monitoring involves monitoring network devices for availability and failures. 
On the other hand, network traffic monitoring is about monitoring what protocols and data are circulating on a network and monitoring performance and security threats.

Bandwidth monitoring
Bandwidth  determines the rate of data movement on a network.
Bandwidth is like the road, you can only accommodate so many cars before the road becomes blocked. That's why it's critical to monitor what's using a lot of bandwidth.

User monitoring
When monitoring the network, you also want to track users to see what applications they use and what their regular daily activities are. This can create an audit trail, but more importantly, 
it reveals patterns so you can better understand how network traffic behaves on a day-to-day basis. Knowing how the network behaves makes it easier to identify when something is not right.

Network traffic monitoring steps
Network monitoring can be divided into three steps: 
Step 1 is choosing the right data source. 
Step 2 involves analyzing the correct component in a network. 
Step 3 is using a monitoring tool to optimize and display the data in a readable format.

Step 1: Choosing data source and protocols
To monitor network traffic, you need to determine the best source. This monitoring can be divided into two categories: packet capture and flow analysis.

Packet capture
This is a way of collecting copies of packets that are moving across a network. You may decide to do this at different points on the network using a computer running packet capture software and a mirrored port.
A mirrored port is created to copy all data passing through it to the port on your computer and to the connected packet capture software. 
Traditionally, an application called Wireshark has been the best option for carrying out this activity.

Flow Analysis
Flow analysis is supported by many network devices and is typically a built-in feature. Two protocols that can do this are called Netflow and Sflow.
Netflow is a Cisco proprietary protocol that runs on Cisco routers and switches. Sflow is designed to work across platforms.
Netflow only collects IP traffic, but SFlow can collect and analyze data from layers 2 to 7 of the OSI model. 
This type of analysis does not copy data from one port to another, so it is very flexible as data can be collected centrally.

Step 2: Selecting the Correct Component
Devices on the network that can support traffic monitoring include servers, switches, routers, and firewalls. You can even monitor specific interfaces and their applications, in addition to devices.
However, you do not want to capture everything that happens everywhere on the network, as this will generate a lot of data for analysis. You need to choose the main areas of the network that oversee communication.

But as the network grows, packet capture will only be used to troubleshoot specific problems in a specific area, as it is restricted to the area you are connected to. 
Flow analysis does not capture entire data packets like packet capture. 
Instead, it captures packet details such as ports and IP addresses. In other words, just the information needed to understand data from many different devices at the same time.

Step 3: Use monitoring tools
When a network grows, so does the amount of data flow that you will need to analyze, and this is when you need third-party software that can collect all flow traffic. 
There are many different traffic monitoring tools that are very capable of analyzing flows and putting the data into an easy-to-read format. 
Typically, they also include tools to alert a network manager about problems or anomalies in the network.



Health analytics and metrics

Health and metric analysis are about spotting trends and patterns in data collected from network traffic monitoring. 
The identified trends and patterns can then be used to proactively introduce traffic management methods to keep the network healthy. 
Traffic management methods can ensure that the capacities on network devices are maximized without overloading them thereby increasing the return on investment or ROI. 
Metric analysis involves measuring key performance statistics to understand how something is performing and predict its future performance based on the gathered data. 
Tools used for this prediction generally need at least 30 days worth of data to create a baseline performance. 
For a network, there are several different metrics that can help determine network health and performance. 


First is bandwidth usage. 
This metric is about checking that you are not going over the amount of available bandwidth. 
If the bandwidth usage is too high, it can affect the network's performance by slowing things down.
The second metric is packet loss. 
When packets get lost on the network between the source and destination, you know that TCP can re-send those lost packets. 
But that can actually create more congestion on the network if it occurs too often. 
The third is latency. 
This is how long a packet takes to move across the network and back again. It's also known as the round trip time or RTT. 
Last is network availability. 
This is a key metric because it reflects up time on the network. In other words, it tells you when the network is working and when it is not. 
These metrics and others can tell you how healthy your network is and how well it's performing.

traffic management. A network can be set up to manage its performance by utilizing something called Quality of Service or QoS. 
QoS is a suite of different traffic management mechanisms that can be used at different times based on network performance. 
Although traffic monitoring is ongoing, traffic management mechanisms should only be turned on when needed. 
If everything works as it should, you don't need to create extra work. Two of the mechanisms included in QoS are traffic marking and prioritization.

https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/qos-quality-of-service

For example, real-time information like video calls should be prioritized. Less critical traffic, like email can be given a low priority.


this information should not only be monitored; they must also be registered. -> log file

Typically, logs contain five header areas. Are they:

Timestamp - the time of the event.
Record level - the degree of severity or importance of the event.
Username - who caused the event.
Service or application - what caused the event.
Event description - what happened.


Types of log files

Event Log - Records information about network traffic usage and tracks login attempts, application events, and failed password attempts.
System log (or syslog) - records operating system events, including startup messages, system changes, shutdowns, errors, and warnings.
Server Log - Contains a record of activity in a text document related to a specific server over a specific period of time.
Change Log - Lists changes made to an application or file.
Availability Log - Tracks system uptime, availability, and performance.
Authorization and access log - lists who is accessing applications or files.
Resource log - Provides information about connectivity issues and any capacity issues.

Logs can be stored in several different formats. Applications like Windows Event Viewer make it easy to troubleshoot and view different events. 
But not all devices on a network have a graphical application like the event viewer on a Windows PC. Many logs are plain text files

have a tool that can capture, display and even analyze the logs for you. For example, Windows Azure Monitor

findstr is the command to use in the command prompt application. Linux uses grep command
Windows PowerShell is another powerful tool used to filter and search using the Select-String command. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/select-string?view=powershell-7.3


remote access also poses some cybersecurity risks. 
First, remote access software is a prime target. When remote access software is unsecured, outdated or unpatched, it can allow unrestricted network access to anyone on the internet.
Weak authentication, like simple passwords, can allow cybercriminals to take over user accounts. 
criminals can also exploit remote users by sending fake remote access links or malicious attachments in phishing emails.

VPNs are widely used for remote access to corporate networks because they provide an improved level of security. VPNs use many different protocols for authentication, data encryption, and tunneling.
Tunneling is a process by which VPN software connects to the destination and sends data. Some of the protocols VPNs use include IPSec, SSL or TLS, PPTP, L2TP, and OpenVPN and others. 
VPNs provide a secure and private connection between two devices over the Internet. VPNs use encryption and authentication for your Internet traffic,
making it difficult for third parties to intercept or eavesdrop on your traffic.

RDP is built into the Windows operating systems and is commonly used for remote access to individual computers or servers. 

But what if you need to connect over an unsecured network like free public WiFi? Well, in unsecured networks, IT technicians use the Secure Shell

Remote Access Services, or RAS, a Microsoft technology that allows dialing into a network from a remote location. 
It allows remote users to establish a secure connection to the network over a phone line or the internet. 
RAS is a predecessor of Routing and Remote Access Service, or RRAS. This built-in Windows operating system tool enables remote access and routing services. 
It can be used to create a VPN server as well as dial up, and wireless networking connections. RRAS also supports several authentication methods. 

How does DHCP work?
When a device connects to a network, it sends an IP address request to the DHCP server. 
The DHCP server then assigns an available IP address to the device, along with other network configuration settings such as
Subnet mask
Default gateway
DNS server addresses

DHCP uses a process called leasing to specify IP addresses. When a device needs IP addresses and sends a request to the DHC server, 
the server assigns it an address from the pool of available IP addresses. Additionally, the server assigns a lease time to the IP address, 
which is the length of time that the device can use the IP address before it needs to be renewed.
When the lease time expires, the device must renew the IP address by requesting a new lease from the DHCP server. 
If the IP address is still available, the server will renew the lease and extend the lease term. If the IP address is no longer available, 
the server assigns the device a new IP address.

One way to improve the security of passwordless authentication is by incorporating a two-factor authentication system.

authentication protocols that organizations use, such as LDAP, which stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
LDAP is a protocol used to access and manage centralized user authentication and authorization. 
Azure Active Directory is a very popular service that uses LDAP, or RADIUS, which stands for Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service. 
RADIUS is a client-server protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting management for users who connect and use a network service. 
It is often used for remote access to networks. 
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+). This is a security protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting services. 
TACACS+ separates authentication, authorization and accounting functions, allowing for more granular control of access to network resources.

Another protocol is called certificate-based authentication, which is an authentication method that uses digital certificates to verify the identity of a user, device, or application.
And lastly, Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides mutual authentication between a client and a server in a network environment. 
It protects businesses against password sniffing attacks by encrypting authentication credentials. It is commonly used in Windows domains.


Authorization templates

Role-based access control (RBAC): RBAC is a model that assigns permissions and privileges to users based on their predefined roles in an organization. 
This model is designed to simplify the management of large-scale systems by reducing the need for individual user-level permissions. 
This is the most common and widely adopted access control model. With RBAC, you can easily form a group of individuals, assign them to a role, and then grant or deny permissions based on that role.



Wi-Fi router security protocols

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy): WEP is an older wireless security protocol that is no longer considered secure. WEP uses a shared key to authenticate users and encrypt data. 
However, WEP is vulnerable to security breaches and its encryption can be easily broken.

WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access): WPA is a wireless security protocol that offers stronger encryption and authentication than the older WEP standard. WPA uses a passphrase or key to authenticate users and encrypt data. 
WPA2 is the latest version of WPA and is considered the most secure wireless security protocol.

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II): WPA2 is the most widely supported wireless security protocol today. 
It uses a stronger encryption algorithm than WPA and offers better protection against hackers and security breaches.

WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access II with Pre-Shared Key): WPA2-PSK is a version of WPA2 that uses a pre-shared key (PSK) for authentication. 
This means that all devices that connect to the wireless network must know the same PSK to access the network.

EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security): EAP-TLS is a wireless security protocol widely used in enterprise-grade networks. 
It offers robust security using digital certificates to authenticate users and encrypt data. EAP-TLS is considered one of the most secure wireless security protocols available.

MAC-based security: MAC-based security is a wireless security protocol that uses a device's Media Access Control (MAC) address to authenticate users and grant access to the wireless network. 
MAC-based security is more secure than WEP, but less secure than WPA or WPA2.

How to keep a wireless network secure
Remember to change the default username and password
Always use strong encryption: It is essential to enable WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) encryption on your router to secure your wireless network.
Set up a guest network: If you frequently have visitors who need to use Wi-Fi, set up a guest network with a different password to keep the main network secure.
Enable MAC address filtering: MAC address filtering allows you to restrict access to your network by only allowing specific devices with pre-approved MAC addresses to connect.
Keep your router's firmware up to date: Router manufacturers regularly release firmware updates to address security vulnerabilities. Make sure to keep your router's firmware up to date by regularly checking for updates.
Disable remote management: Unless you need it, disable remote management on your router. It is a security risk as it allows cybercriminals to access router settings from outside your network.

DDoS is one of many kinds of cybersecurity attacks, and it involves multiple sources simultaneously flooding a network with traffic, making it impossible to operate. 

A network attack is mostly an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer network, system, or device with the intent of stealing, damaging, or manipulating data.

Active attacks are usually easier to detect than passive attacks because they typically involve some level of disruption to network operations, such as modifying or stealing data.

Sniffing is part of espionage and involves listening to communication between two devices, intercepting it, capturing it and analyzing it. 
This type of attack can steal your data remotely, without even physically accessing your computer.
The sniffing software simply sits in between the communication process, sees what's coming in and out, and reads it all.

Spoofing is done using specialized software or tools to modify packet headers, forge DNS responses, or create ARP packets. 
This allows attackers to intercept or redirect network traffic, bypass security controls, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. 
In IP spoofing, for example, the attacker changes the source IP address in the IP packet header, making it appear as if the packet originates from a legitimate source. 
In DNS spoofing, the attacker provides a forged DNS response, directing the user to a malicious website. 
The main objective of spoofing is to deceive network components or users, allowing the attacker to carry out various malicious activities while disguising himself as a trusted entity. 
Tools like hping, scapy or Nmap are used to carry out spoofing attacks.

----- Network attacks

eavesdropping, which involves intercepting and reading data transmitted over a network. 
This can include sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. Eavesdropping involves various tools and could be an automatic or manual process. These tools are used for intercepting, capturing, and analyzing network traffic.
This process is called packet sniffing. The impact of eavesdropping can be severe as it can lead to data exposure and information theft.

 Packet spoofing is when an attacker sends packets of data with a forged source address to make it appear that the packets are coming from a trusted source. 
The purpose of packet spoofing is often to trick the recipient into accepting the packets as legitimate and allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the recipient's network or systems. 

 IP Spoofing. And it involves forging the source IP address of a network packet to make it appear as though it came from a trusted source. This can be used to gain unauthorized access to a network or to steal data.
To prevent Spoofing, it is essential to implement network filters to prevent Spoofed packets from entering the network.

 man-in-the-middle attack involves intercepting communication between two parties and relaying messages between them. 
This gives the appearance of normal communication while secretly eavesdropping and potentially modifying the messages. This can lead to information theft, data exposure, and unauthorized access.

---- malicious common attacks

Another malicious attack type is Backdoors, and just like the name suggests, it involves creating a hidden entry point into a network or system that bypasses standard security measures. 
Backdoors can be used to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or install malware.

password cracking, which involves attempting to guess or crack a user's password to gain access to their account. 
This can affect not only users, but also servers, Wi-Fi routers, or any network resource that is protected with a password. 

SQL injection. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language used to access and alter database tables and records, and SQL injection is one of the most common attacks against web applications. 
It causes significant damage to organizations and businesses that use databases to store sensitive data. 
With SQL injection, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in SQL statements to access sensitive information such as usernames and passwords and use this information for further attacks. 


---- Cracking Wi-Fi passwords 

Dictionary attack: The attacker uses a list of commonly used passwords or phrases to attempt to systematically gain access to the network.

Brute force attack: The attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of characters to discover the password. This method can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Rainbow Table Attack: The attacker uses precomputed tables of hashed password combinations (called rainbow tables) to quickly look up the plaintext password corresponding to a given hash. 
This method can be faster than brute force, but it requires significant storage resources. A password hash is a mathematically calculated, encrypted version of your password.

suspicious signs of a phishing attack. 
These signs include:
First-time or infrequent senders
Incompatible email domains
Generic greetings
Urgent calls for action or threats
Inadequate spelling and grammar
Suspicious links or unexpected attachments


-------- Network security

Effective network security is built upon three core principles. 
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. 
Integrity guarantees that your data remains accurate and unaltered. 
Availability ensures that your digital resources are accessible to authorized users whenever needed. 

network security tools, 
Firewalls are the first line of defense for all networks and a critical tool in the network security toolbox. 
firewalls prevent suspicious traffic from coming in or going out of the network. But they also stopped port scanning. 
Another crucial tool is passwords, which is not just for protecting user accounts, but also to secure servers, Wi-Fi networks, and other network devices.
should also implement passwordless authentication and multi-factor authentication where possible, for an extra layer of security
An Intrusion Detection System or IDS, is another preventative tool. It continuously monitors networks for any signs of suspicious activity or potential threats.
An IDS analyzes network traffic patterns and compares them against known attack signatures
Anti-malware tools also form a part of the network security toolbox.
network administrators should perform regular network maintenance tasks which can protect against various types of attacks. 
Network administrators should regularly update software, perform vulnerability assessments, and monitor traffic and system logs. 
Finally, it's crucial to educate the users in your network because human error is often considered the main weak link in a network

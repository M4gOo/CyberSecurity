It is a feature that creates restore points that allow you to set your devices to a previously healthier state before changes may have led to malfunctions or data loss. It is your backup plan.



----------- THREAT LANDSCAPE  

The threat landscape evaluation of every possible and identified threat affecting a particular sector, group of users, time period, and so forth.

Threat landscape analysis makes it possible to see potential information security problems facing a specific entity — a company, an individual, or a whole sector — and to take preventive measures by adopting a proactive approach to information security. 
This can help to identify weaknesses in the environment.

The first step toward implementing effective safeguards is to better understand the types of threats that are out there. 


----------COMMON ATTACKS

TROJAN

Although Trojans behave differently depending on the type, a feature of this common approach is that a user inadvertently introduces malicious code into the organization and triggers it from behind defensive walls. 
The best defense against Trojan attacks is to practice vigilant Internet use. 
Some guidelines are: never click on an unsolicited email with unexpected attachments
always examine domain names and links before clicking on them
Pay particular attention to spelling errors, such as zeros that have been replaced by O's

These requests can come from any Internet of Things (IoT) capable device that has an IP address.
A defensive approach to mitigating these types of attacks is to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. If a particular source is identified as making repeated calls that affect a system's operations, that address may be blocked.
